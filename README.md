# Welcome to the AI Airlift: Intelligent Apps+Agents

Welcome to this three-day AI Airlift focused on Intelligent Apps/Agents and Knowledge Mining. In these three days, we will focus on hands-on activities that develop proficiency in AI-oriented services such as Azure Bot Services, Azure Search (including Cognitive Search), and Cognitive Services. Additionally, we will provide various design and architecture guidance/activities so you are not only able to build POC/solutions, but so you are also able to architect and design them.  

# Goals

Most challenges observed by customers in these realms are in stitching multiple services together. As such, where possible, we have tried to place key concepts in the context of broader examples. 

At the end of this 300-level workshop, you should be able to:

- Build an application that calls various Cognitive Services APIs (specifically Computer Vision)
- For Cognitive Services, determine what to use when and how to combine multiple to increase the intelligence and capabilities of bots/apps 
- Understand how to implement Azure Search features to provide a positive search experience inside applications
- Configure an Azure Search service to extend your data to enable full-text, language-aware search
- Design and build a Cognitive Search solution
- Build, train, and publish a LUIS model to help your bot communicate effectively
- Be able to efficiently and effectively design LUIS schema
- Build an intelligent bot using Microsoft Bot Framework that leverages LUIS and Azure Search
- Understand how adding Bing Search capabilities can enhance applications
- Integrate a Bing Search API (specifically Bing Image Search) into an existing bot application
- Be able to decide the most appropriate architectural components common bot use-cases
- Effectively leverage the Custom Vision Service to create image classification and object detection models that can then be leveraged by an application
